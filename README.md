# Colors Again

# This Program uses Hue, Saturation, and Lightness, and Alpha (HSLa) to pick colors with a slider bar for each of these properties.

# There is a random color button and an Opacity (Alpha) setting as well with a picture in the background from which to judge the opacity.

# This project was built with REACT.js 'Hooks'
